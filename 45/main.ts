// Qno: 45 Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object.
//  The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should 
//  then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the 
//  required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional 
//  feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.


// Defince a function to create a car object with optional options.
