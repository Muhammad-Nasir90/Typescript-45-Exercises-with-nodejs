// • If the alien’s color isn’t green, print a statement that the player just earned 10 points.

// • Write one version of this program that runs the if block and another that runs the else block.

// Condition 1:

let alienColor = "Red";


if(alienColor === "Red") {

    console.log("Player just earned 5 point for shooting the alien")
}
else  {
    console.log("Player just earned 10 Points")
}

// Condition 2:
 

if(alienColor === "black") {

    console.log("Player just earned 5 point for shooting the alien")
}
else  {
    console.log("Player just earned 10 Points")
}
